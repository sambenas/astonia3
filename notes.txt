Various things discovered during testing:

- Header files don't have header guards

- Some game files are dynamically loaded at runtime, probably can just be static?  Not sure really.
  At least for now -static seems to potentially break some things

- Might not be compatible with glibc 2.32+ due to pthread_sigmask issue.  Dynamic/Static linking issue?
  Nah, need -pthread CFLAG and -lpthread LDFLAG
