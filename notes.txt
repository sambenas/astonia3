Various things discovered:

- Header files don't have header guards (FIXED)

- Some game files are dynamically loaded at runtime, probably can just be static?  Not sure really.
  At least for now -static seems to potentially break some things in the mysql client

- Client is not cross-compiled, it is compiled on a windows machine with
  borland by default. Relies on windows libraries not available on linux, e.g. directx

- Direct Draw Lib is deprecated and might need to be replaced
  - e.g. OpenGL, just use Java's libgdx, or godot or something
  - Also figure out how to link zlib and png on mingw using C so we
    can extract raw client assets

- Overall the code is a mess.  Lots of declarations in C files and definitions in
  other C files

- Could use a good clang-format

- The term "ppd" comes up a lot, this is "persistant player data", anything related to a player
  that should be persisted but (I think) is not part of a player directly. E.g., the last time
  they picked a given flower.
