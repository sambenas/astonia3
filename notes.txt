Various things discovered during testing:

- Header files don't have header guards

- Some game files are dynamically loaded at runtime, probably can just be static?  Not sure really.
  At least for now -static seems to potentially break some things

- Might not be compatible with glibc 2.32+ due to pthread_sigmask issue.  Dynamic/Static linking issue?
  Nah, need -pthread CFLAG and -lpthread LDFLAG

- Client is not cross-compiled, it is compiled on a windows machine with
  borland by default.  Might require significant work.
  e.g. windows.h included

- Direct Draw Lib is deprecated and might need to be replaced
  - e.g. OpenGL, just use Java
  - Also figure out how to link zlib and png on mingw
